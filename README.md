# Face_Mask_Detection
In these program we are going to detect weather person is wearing the mask or not.
Here we are using the machine learining algorithm to do these
The algorithm used is the SVM Classifier
The Haar cascade algorithm is use for the face detection 
For traing purpose we have capture 400 with mask and 400 without mask images of ourself at different angle
We can also use the available dataset 
The 75% images were used for the training the model and remaining 25% were used for the testing purpose
